My first ever exposure to unity and programming, followed this great video tutorial by one of the best game-dev channel Brackeys https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j48LtUkZRjU&list=PLPV2KyIb3jR53Jce9hP7G5xC4O9AgnOuL




Sorry for the terrible UI (but... never mind, I was a kid at that time!)

Run the setup and install the game.
Enjoy!!!
